# An ABC guide on how to deal with an unresponsive SME

**Nobody knows everything.** That is why every technical writer has to communicate with different stakeholders to get the necessary information needed to perform their work correctly. Very often they reach out to the so-called SME-s to gain clarity about a certain topic. 

Some of them are really helpful and willing to share knowledge whereas some of them may be more challenging to approach. Don’t let that discourage you. Below I prepared an **ABC guide with some tips & tricks on how to work efficiently with an (unresponsive) SME** based also on my own experiences.

For those of you who may not be familiar with the term SME: an **SME is an is a professional who has extensive knowledge of a specific area of expertise.** SME-s are experienced individuals and go-to people if  you want to get to know more about a particular topic.

Let’s go! 😊

## A like... Appreciate
Appreciate the SME you turn to to get information. All in all, they devote some valuable time from their busy workday to help you solve the issues you're dealing with. You can just **say thank you**, send an accolade or even give them a small gift to show that you care. A good idea could be to let know also their managers how supportive they are.

## B like... Be concrete
Of course you may not know a lot about a particular subject, that's why you turn to an SME in the first place - to gain some knowledge. However, make sure that you do your homework and **prepare yourself** before you start asking questions that could be easily answered through just some basic research.

## C like... Communication is key
As a technical writer you will have to **communicate with various stakeholders and various SME-s**.
They will have different personalities and you will need to be able to adjust. It is your role to find out what and how to speak to each of them to gain the most out of each conversation.
What's OK for one person, may not be fine with the other.

## D like... Don't expect too much
The bigger our expectations are, the more we can get disappointed if something goes in a different way than we thought. Sometimes it's better to simply embrace what will come up during a conversation with an SME and **refrain from being overly demanding.**

## E like... Escalate only when needed
Sometimes you are really pressed for time and need information which cannot be found anywhere or the information is scarce. Some knowledge from a skilled SME is essential to deliver the project on time but they don't respond. **It may be tempting to escalate but use this mechanism with caution.** It is easy to damage the connection at the very beginning and than be in a losing position when it comes to possible future cooperation with the SME.

## F like... Fun
Work is work and tasks need to be done, but even then **you don't have to be serious all the time.** In the majority of cases a bit of fun or a joke every now and then will probably lighten the atmosphere and be actually very helpful while cooperating with SME-s.

## G like... Give, don’t just take
I already touched upon this under *A like… Appreciation* but it may go beyond saying thank you. It may actually happen that you will know something that is of interest for the SME and you will be able to **exchange your knowledge.** It is a win-win situation where both sites can take something out of it.

## H like... Human
Yes, an **SME is just a human**, just like you and me. They may have a bad day, be tired or have other stuff going in their life which may affect their performance and attitude. Keep that in mind and don’t take it personally. 

## I like... Initiate
You are the one who has to make the first move here. It is you who wants to get to know something that an SME knows, not the other way round so **you need to be proactive.**

## J like... Just keep going
You reached to an SME but there is no response? Time is running out and you don't know what to do? **Just keep going.** Go again through all available resources, try to find out if there is another SME who could help you with your work. Use your subjective judgement and common sense to finish the task. Be cautious with escalating the issue but do so if you see no other option.

## K like... Keep it simple 
Paraphrasing the title of Steve Krug’s well-known book on user experience design - "don't let your SME think". Tell them exactly what you need (or what you suppose you need), **make it easy for them to help you.** Don’t leave any doubts.

## L like... Listen
**Listen carefully to what the SME is saying.** Make notes or even record your conversation so that you can come back to the material whenever needed.

## M like... Motivation
**Don't lose your motivation**, even if you don't see any progress in communication and cooperation with an SME. Sometimes it's just information that you need to change your approach.

## N like... Networking
Treat reaching out to an SME as networking. You may actually start establishing contact with an SME before you need something from them, so that when it happens, they will be much more willing to help because they will already know you. The well-known principle **you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours** also applies here.

## O like... Options
What worked surprisingly well for me was reaching out to SME-s with a few **options to choose from.** Instead of asking them “Hey, can you help me with xyz?”, I wrote “Hey, I have an xyz issue. Can we meet do discuss xyz or will you write down abc about xyz?” This may not work with every SME but you may try it.

## P like... Positive attitude
Nobody likes to work with a grumpy, dissatisfied individual who keeps on complaining and has a demanding attitude. **A smile on your face** can do wonders. Keep that in mind while interacting with basically anyone, not just SME-s.

## Q like... Questions
A problem well-defined is a problem half solved. **Asking the right questions** can bring more value and take less time than asking many questions.

## R like... Repeat
Sometimes you need to ping the SME more than once. SME-s tend to be very busy so they may overlook your messages or classify them as not important if you don’t **remind them about yourself and your issue.**

## S like... Set the cooperation rules
Especially if you know that you will regularly cooperate with the SME it’s worth to **establish some rules on how the cooperation will look like.** Will you communicate verbally or in writing? How often? How much time per week/month? It will definitely put more structure into your teamwork.

## T like... Tribal knowledge
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term - **tribal knowledge** describes a situation in which there is knowledge within an organization that is not documented anywhere and exists only in the minds of the people who know something about an issue, a process etc. This isn’t a desirable phenomenon, especially within big structures, like international companies. By reaching out to SME-s and asking questions, **you play an important role in taking this useful knowledge to light**, so let that be your motivation to **be persistent** while dealing with an unresponsive SME.

## U like... User
Technical writers are also sometimes referred to as **user advocates.** This is because even the best documentation cannot make up for a bad, unintuitive design. Keep in mind that representing the user and their issues may sometimes mean to handle an uncooperative SME as well 😉

## V like… Visibility
Visibility can be a powerful tool in a company. **When people know you and what you are doing, you are more likely to receive the needed support.** I personally have had a few situations in which I was able to gain the information I needed mainly because the person I turned to knew me from my other projects.

## W like... Why behind something 
Many SME-s seem to be much more cooperative when they **see the why behind** things. A short explanation of what do you need the information for and how it fits into a bigger picture work well at least with certain types of SME-s.

## X like... X-factor
The X factor understood as a **quality that you cannot describe that makes someone very special** may be a game changer as well. It sometimes goes hand in hand with someone’s visibility. The X factor may be also someone's very **well developed personal and social skills** so it’s definitely worth to polish them on an everyday basis.

## Y like... “You have to”
For me personally one of the most annoying type of people coming to get something from me were the ones who started their talk with “you have to”. “You have to tell me xyz because you are an SME.” Or even “you have to prepare this” without any explanation and with no idea what they actually wanted. **Don't confuse being direct with being arrogant.** Don't go this way.

## Z like... Zest
Whoever you work with, **enthusiasm and engagement will always stand out positively.** A person who is genuinely committed to what they do, truly inspires and other people want to cooperate with them. The zest and energy with which you approach your daily tasks, shines through, making you confidently pursue your goals.
